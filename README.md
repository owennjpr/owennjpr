# Hi I'm Owen (he/him)
I am an Undergraduate Computer Science and Science and Technology Studies major at Tufts University from Seattle, Washington. I'm passionate about software development, music, and games and you can find some of the projects I've been working on here. These include:

## [PeakSynth](https://github.com/owennjpr/PeakSynth-Audio-Plugin)
- An audio plugin created with the JUCE framework, capable of interfacing with any Digital Audio Workstation.
- A mix between a synthesizer and a sampler that uses IIR filtering to "play" an audio file with MIDI.
- User MIDI input is converted into a series of peak filters at frequencies corresponding to the notes being played. Depending on the character of the audio file being used, this can lead to lots of variety of outcomes.

## [Owlhead](https://github.com/gmccar05/owlhead)
- Part of an ongoing research project with the Tufts University Human Factors IDEA Lab.
- Experimenting with alterations to perception in VR, including field of view increase, and accelerated turning rate.
- This repository consists of virtual test environments in the Unity Game Engine where we record user experiences and performance.

## [Untitled Unity Project](https://github.com/owennjpr/Summer2023Game)
- Working with [asendlakowski](https://github.com/asendlakowski) to build a 3D first-person exploration and puzzle game in Unity which will begin playtesting in January.
