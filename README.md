I am a recent graduate from Tufts University with a BS in Computer Science and Science, Technology, and Society (STS), originally from Seattle, Washington. My work focuses on web development, audio, and software designed for social impact. Check out my [portfolio](https://owennjpr.github.io/portfolio/) for a more in depth look at what I've been up to, or just take a look at some of my current projects here!

## I'm Currently Working On
### [Freebites](https://www.freebites.org/)
- A mobile app helping college students find free food opportunities on campus.
- Developing feature updates, optimizations, and building out our web presence with [freebites.org](https://www.freebites.org/)

### [Char-Mo](https://github.com/owennjpr/Char-Mo)
- An open source React library for ascii character based text animations.
- While the end goal is to create an npm package, you can see current examples of different effects and code snippets [here](https://dynamic-text-tau.vercel.app/).
- If you want to contribute and make your own effects feel free to make a PR and I'll take a look!

### [formerly.me](https://formerly.me/)
- A living website and web art project showcasing my original music including some algorithmic musical compositions ([Macrobiome](https://formerly.me/macrobiome), [Tone Garden](https://formerly.me/tonegarden)) built with React, TypeScript, and the web audio API

<!--
### [PeakSynth](https://github.com/owennjpr/PeakSynth-Audio-Plugin)
- An audio plugin created with the JUCE framework, capable of interfacing with any Digital Audio Workstation.
- A mix between a synthesizer and a sampler that uses IIR filtering to "play" an audio file with MIDI.
- User MIDI input is converted into a series of peak filters at frequencies corresponding to the notes being played. Depending on the character of the audio file being used, this can lead to a variety of outcomes.

### [Owlhead](https://github.com/gmccar05/owlhead)
- An ongoing research project with the Tufts University Human Factors IDEA Lab.
- Experimenting with alterations to perception in VR, including field of view increase, and accelerated turning rate.
- This repository consists of virtual test environments in the Unity Game Engine where we record user experiences and performance.

### Other
#### [Shredasaurus](https://owennjpr.itch.io/shredasaurus)
- Unity game developed with a team of 5 for the DinoJam 4 game jam
- Rated 5th out of 26 submissions so you know its gotta be good
#### [Lumina (Unity Game)](https://github.com/owennjpr/Summer2023Game)
